# Implementation Guide for Todo App

## Project Overview

This project is a **Todo Management App** built using the **MERN** stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). It provides an intuitive user interface for managing daily tasks with features like creating new tasks, deleting tasks, editing existing tasks, and viewing detailed information for each task. The app also supports adding tags, priorities, and mentions to tasks, offering a personalized experience for managing to-dos.

### Key Features:

* Create, read, update, and delete tasks
* Support for task titles, descriptions, tags, and priorities (High, Medium, Low)
* Mentions of users in tasks (e.g., @username)
* Ability to add notes via a modal
* Task details with tags, priorities, and users
* Pagination support for efficient task management
* Filtering and sorting by tags, priority, and other criteria

---

## Tech Stack

This project leverages the **MERN** stack:

* **MongoDB**: Database for storing todos and related metadata like tags, priorities, and user mentions.
* **Express.js**: A Node.js framework for building the backend API to handle HTTP requests.
* **React**: Frontend library to create interactive user interfaces, displaying todos and handling user interactions.
* **Node.js**: Backend runtime environment for handling server-side logic.

Additionally, some key features:

* **CSS**: Custom styles for the appâ€™s UI
* **Axios/Fetch**: Used for making HTTP requests between the frontend and the backend.
* **Modal**: A modal for adding notes to the todo item.

---

## Testing

### Unit Testing:

1. **Frontend**: You can use Jest and React Testing Library to test React components for expected behaviors such as rendering and event handling.

   * `npm test` will run the tests in your `src` folder.
2. **Backend**: Use Mocha or Jest to test API endpoints, request validation, and database operations.

### End-to-End Testing:

For full end-to-end testing of the app, tools like **Cypress** can be employed to simulate user interactions and ensure tasks are created, updated, deleted, and displayed correctly.

## Code Overview

### **Frontend (React)**

* **App.js**: This file is the main entry point for the React app. It initializes the state of todos and handles user input for adding new tasks. It fetches todos from the backend API and maps them to `TodoItem` components.

* **TodoItem.js**: Represents each individual task. It displays the task's name and completion status, provides the ability to delete the task, and shows an interactive checkbox for marking tasks as completed.

* **App.css**: Contains all the styling for the app, including layout and UI elements like buttons, form fields, todo items, etc.

* **Components**: The application is split into components like `TodoItem`, which renders the UI for individual todos. `App.js` manages the overall logic, such as fetching todos, creating new ones, and updating the UI based on user actions.

### **Backend (Node/Express)**

* **Server.js**: This is the entry point for the backend, which sets up the Express server, connects to MongoDB, and defines the API routes for managing todos.

* **TodoModel.js**: A Mongoose model representing the Todo item schema in MongoDB. It defines the structure of a todo with fields like `title`, `description`, `completed`, `tags`, `priority`, etc.

* **Routes**:

  * **GET /todos**: Fetches all the todos from the database.
  * **POST /new**: Creates a new todo with the provided details.
  * **DELETE /delete/\:id**: Deletes a todo by its ID.

## How to Run the App

### Prerequisites:

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

* **Node.js** (v12 or later)
* **MongoDB** (locally or use a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas)
* **npm** or **yarn** (to install dependencies)

### 1. Backend Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd todo-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Navigate to the `backend` folder (if separate) or directly in the root folder, and run:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up MongoDB**:

   * You can either use a local MongoDB instance or set up a MongoDB Atlas cloud database.
   * In `server.js`, update the connection string to your MongoDB instance:

     ```js
     mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost/todoapp', { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true });
     ```

4. **Run the backend server**:

   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

   The server will be running on `http://localhost:4001`.

### 2. Frontend Setup

1. **Navigate to the frontend folder** (if separated):

   ```bash
   cd client
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the frontend**:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the React development server at `http://localhost:3000`. The frontend will make API requests to the backend running on `http://localhost:4001`.

### 3. Testing the App

* **Open the app in a browser**: `http://localhost:3000`
* You should see a functional todo app with the ability to add, delete, and view todos.

You can now interact with the app, and make requests from the frontend to the backend to manage your todos.

## Future Enhancements

* **Authentication**: Integrate user authentication (e.g., JWT, OAuth) to manage users.
* **Notifications**: Implement email or push notifications when a task is assigned or mentioned.
* **Deployment**: Deploy the application using cloud platforms like AWS, Heroku, or DigitalOcean.
